### What I learned

Originally I wanted to code this layout with Bootstrap. Unfortunately I wasn't able to do it.

I dedided to code it vanilla in the end. I debated with myself, if the Add to cart element should be a button or a link styled as a button. I think it should be a button of submit type, in a form, because it submits the choice to the shopping cart.

```html
<form action="#">
  <button class="card__add-button" type="submit">
    <img src="./images/icon-cart.svg" alt="cart icon"> 
    Add to Cart
  </button>
</form>
```

### Continued development

I still want to do this challenge with Bootstrap, with Sass modifications and all. I need to learn it first.
